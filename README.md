# Byzantine Resilience Explorer
**Fixed-Point Network Dynamics with Interactive Attack Simulation**

This project simulates a **Byzantine-resilient network** of 100,000 nodes using **fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16)** and **geometric median consensus**. It provides an interactive visualization of network integrity under adversarial conditions, including **drift, opposing, split, and oscillate attacks**.

### Key Features:
- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Ensures numerical stability for large-scale simulations.
- **Geometric Median Consensus**: Robust to up to 50% Byzantine nodes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust Byzantine ratio and attack type live.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Audit score, entropy, and SHA-256 fingerprinting.
- **Visual Collapse Detection**: Highlights network failure when integrity drops below 50%.
