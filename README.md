# 🧠 Sparse Manifold Regulation (SMR)

Adaptive sparsity control in a diffusive probability field using PDE dynamics and feedback control.

Sparse Manifold Regulation (SMR) is a high-fidelity numerical simulation demonstrating how continuous diffusion (entropy growth) can be actively counterbalanced using a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to maintain a target sparsity ratio in a probability manifold.

This project bridges:

**Partial Differential Equations • Control Theory • Information Theory • Numerical Stability**

## The system simulates:

- A probability density undergoing continuous diffusion  
- A dynamic threshold that suppresses mass to maintain silence  
- A feedback controller that converges to a target sparsity ratio  

Result: a self-stabilizing sparse manifold.


## Features

- Implicit PDE solver (unconditionally stable)
- Real-time PI feedback control
- Entropy energy monitoring
- High-resolution manifold dynamics
- Command-line parameterization
- Automated convergence notification
- Multi-panel analytics visualization
